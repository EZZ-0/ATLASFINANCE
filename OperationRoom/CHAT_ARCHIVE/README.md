# Chat Archive

**Purpose:** Store daily chat logs to prevent LIVE_CHAT.md from bloating.

## Archive Protocol

When LIVE_CHAT.md exceeds ~50 messages:

1. Copy everything below the "CONVERSATION LOG" line
2. Create new file: `CHAT_[YYYY-MM-DD].md`
3. Paste the content
4. Clear LIVE_CHAT.md (keep headers, add fresh [SYSTEM] message)

## File Naming

```
CHAT_2025-12-07.md
CHAT_2025-12-08.md
```

## Retention

Keep archives for at least 2 weeks for reference.
Older archives can be deleted or moved to long-term storage.
