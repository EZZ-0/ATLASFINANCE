ou are picking either a:
 Eurozone country (other than Denmark, Germany or France) and analyzing should it
leave the Eurozone (basically, what would happen if it left the Eurozone); or,
 An EU-but-non-Eurozone country and analyzing should it join the Eurozone (basically,
what would happen if it joined the Eurozone)
 As of November 18, Greece, Portugal, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Croatia were taken
Basically, you’re addressing the pros and cons of a specific country having the Euro instead of
an independent currency.
You cannot pick Germany or France, because they can’t leave the Eurozone, so it’s a moo(t)
point. You cannot pick Denmark, because it has a hard peg to the Euro, so it doesn’t fit neatly
into either category, plus its main motivation is political.
You will be doing this in groups of no more than 3. The names of the people in the group and
your choice of country should be sent to me ASAP.
Some of the issues you could/should address:
 If the country is in the Eurozone:
o What were the economic conditions (inflation, GDP, etc.) prior to the Euro
adoption?
o Is there a movement within the country right now to leave on its own?
 Is the movement more political or economic in nature? What are the
economic arguments being used to argue for leaving the Eurozone?
o How has the country changed since Euro adoption, and how reasonable would it
be to return to pre-adoption economic condition?
 How has the country handled the financial crisis?
 How has the country handled the sovereign debt crisis?
 What are its biggest trading partners, and how would the partners react to this country
leaving/joining the Eurozone?
o Compare pre-Euro-adoption and post-Euro-adoption trade flows with current
biggest trading partners, or pre- and post-2000 trade flows if they not in the
Eurozone
If an opportunity arises to do any quantitative analysis (analyzing inflation pre- and post-
adoption, looking at trends in variables mandated by the Maastricht Treaty, etc.), take it. The
more of the quantitative analysis you do, the better. In addition to above, there might be a
particular part of the story related to the country you are analyzing that does not fit neatly into
the topics outlined above; if so, feel free to explore it, but try to address the issues above as
much as suitable for you=r country.
