                         PART 1: OVERVIEW
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
1.1 WHAT IS THE OPERATION ROOM?
================================================================================

The Operation Room is a FILE-BASED coordination system that enables multiple
AI agents to work together on the same project AUTONOMOUSLY.

Since AI agents CANNOT directly talk to each other, we use SHARED FILES to
communicate. By reading and writing to these files, agents can:

  - Assign tasks to each other
  - Ask and answer questions
  - Share status updates
  - Coordinate work without conflicts
  - Validate each other's work

THE CORE PRINCIPLE:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Once triggered, agents work CONTINUOUSLY until signaled to stop.       │
  │  Check for messages DURING work, not just at start/end.                 │
  │  WAIT for tasks if inbox is empty - don't stop working.                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

================================================================================
1.2 THE USER (OWNER)
================================================================================

The USER is the project owner and ultimate decision maker.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  USER ROLE                                                                  │
│  ═════════                                                                  │
│                                                                             │
│  You are the OWNER of this project.                                        │

│  WHO REPORTS TO YOU:                                                        │
│  • Architect - Reports progress, decisions needed, blockers, milestones    │
│  • R&D - Reports validation results and research findings                  │
│  • Executor - Does NOT report to you (reports to Architect)                │
│                                                                             │
│  YOUR COMMANDS:                                                             │
│  • Talk to Architect → For planning, decisions, complex requests           │
│  • Send "." to Executor → Triggers CONTINUOUS work mode                    │
│  • Talk to R&D → For research requests or validation reviews               │
│                                                                             │
│  MINIMAL INTERVENTION:                                                      │
│  • Start Architect with your request                                        │
│  • Send "." to Executor (they will wait for & process ALL tasks)           │
│  • Agents work autonomously until Architect signals [SESSION_COMPLETE]     │
│  • You only need to intervene for decisions or blockers                    │
│                                                                             │

│  1. Tell Architect what you want                                            │
│  2. Send "." to Executor (can do immediately - Executor will wait)         │
│  3. Both agents work autonomously                                           │
│  4. Architect signals [SESSION_COMPLETE] when all work done                │

COMMAND FLOW:
  - User talks to Architect (for planning/complex work)
  - User sends "." to Executor (triggers continuous work mode)
  - Architect creates detailed tasks for Executor
  - Executor WAITS for tasks if none available, processes ALL when they arrive
  - Completed features go to R&D for validation

================================================================================
1.5 THE GOLDEN RULES
================================================================================

RULE 1: WORK CONTINUOUSLY UNTIL DONE
         Don't stop after minimal work. Keep going until session complete.
         Executor: WAIT for tasks if inbox empty.

RULE 2: CHECK FOR MESSAGES DURING WORK
         Read LIVE_CHAT.md between steps, not just at start/end.
         React to [URGENT] immediately.

RULE 3: LOCK FILES BEFORE EDITING
         Check LOCKED_FILES.md before editing any code file.
         Add your lock. Post [LOCK] in LIVE_CHAT.

RULE 4: NEVER ASSUME - COMMUNICATE
         If unclear, ask in LIVE_CHAT.md with [Q] prefix.
         Wait for [A] answer before proceeding.

RULE 5: COMPLETE ALL TASKS
         Follow ALL acceptance criteria.
         Process ALL tasks in inbox, not just the first one.

RULE 6: VALIDATE EACH OTHER'S WORK
         Before a task is truly done, the OTHER agent reviews it.

RULE 7: ARCHITECT CONTROLS GIT (CRITICAL)
         Only Architect commits and pushes to git.
         Executor NEVER runs git commands.
         This ensures single source of truth and clean history.

================================================================================
1.6 BATCH MODE TASK PLANNING (CRITICAL)
================================================================================

THIS IS THE KEY TO EFFICIENT OPERATION:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    BATCH MODE = NO MID-SESSION BLOCKS                   │
  │  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════   │
  │                                                                         │
  │  THE PROBLEM (OLD WAY):                                                 │
  │  ──────────────────────                                                 │
  │  • Executor gets blocked waiting for Architect task A003 to complete   │
  │  • Executor posts [WAITING_FOR_TASKS] and sits idle                    │
  │  • User has to re-trigger Executor after A003 is done                  │
  │  • Time wasted, user intervention needed                               │
  │                                                                         │
  │  THE SOLUTION (BATCH MODE):                                             │
  │  ──────────────────────────                                             │
  │  • Architect plans ALL Executor tasks at SESSION START                 │
  │  • NO Executor task depends on any Architect task                      │
  │  • Dependencies only exist WITHIN Executor's own task list (E001→E002) │

BATCH MODE WORKFLOW:

  1. User tells Architect what to build
  2. Architect reads ROADMAP.md and plans:
     - Which tasks Architect will do (complex/design)
     - Which tasks Executor will do (implementation/data)
  3. Architect ensures ZERO Executor→Architect dependencies
  4. If Executor batch is light, Architect pulls filler tasks from roadmap
  5. Architect asks User: "Plan includes [filler tasks]. Confirm?"
  6. User sends "." to Executor
  7. Architect posts ALL Executor tasks in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  8. Architect posts [BATCH_READY] (all Executor tasks are defined)
  9. Both work continuously until done
  10. Executor NEVER waits for Architect

================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
3.1 ARCHITECT RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================================================

As the ARCHITECT, you are responsible for:

  1. ROADMAP: Maintain ROADMAP.md with milestones, objectives, and progress
  2. BATCH PLANNING: Plan ALL Executor tasks at SESSION START (see 3.2a)
  3. NO CROSS-DEPS: Ensure NO Executor task depends on your tasks
  4. COMPLEX WORK: Handle architecture, design, and difficult tasks yourself
  5. DELEGATING: Create detailed tasks for Executor in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  6. SIGNALING: Post [BATCH_READY] when all Executor tasks are defined
  7. COORDINATING: Keep work flowing efficiently
  8. VALIDATING: Review Executor's completed work
  9. DECIDING: Make final calls on technical approaches
  10. COMPLETING: Signal [SESSION_COMPLETE] when ALL work is done

YOU communicate with the User directly.
YOU create tasks for Executor.
YOU ensure Executor NEVER waits for you.
YOU signal when the session is complete.
YOU are the lead of this development team.

EXAMPLE: Good vs Bad Task Dependencies

  ❌ BAD (Executor waits for Architect):
  
     TASK-A001: Design FCF calculator          (Architect)
     TASK-E001: Implement FCF calculator       (Executor - DEPENDS ON A001!)
     → Executor gets blocked waiting for A001!
  
  ✅ GOOD (No cross-dependencies):
  
     TASK-A001: Design FCF calculator          (Architect)
     TASK-A002: Implement FCF calculator       (Architect - does own design+impl)
     TASK-E001: Research FRED API              (Executor - independent)
     TASK-E002: Download Damodaran data        (Executor - independent)
     TASK-E003: Validate AAPL metrics          (Executor - uses E002)
     → Executor never waits for Architect!
  
  ✅ ALSO GOOD (Architect waits for Executor - this is OK):
  
     TASK-E001: Research FRED API              (Executor - goes first)
     TASK-E002: Implement fred_api.py          (Executor - uses E001)
     TASK-A001: Integrate FRED into DCF        (Architect - uses E002 when ready)
     → Architect can wait for Executor. Executor keeps working.

DO NOT:
  - Stop after creating one task
  - Wait for User to ask "what's next"
  - Stop after each small step

DO:
  - Keep working continuously
  - Create multiple tasks as needed
  - Work on your own tasks while Executor works on theirs
  - Only stop when everything is complete

================================================================================
3.4 CREATING TASKS FOR EXECUTOR
================================================================================

When you need Executor to do something:

  1. Open INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  2. Add a NEW task using the COMPLETE template below
  3. Post in LIVE_CHAT.md: "[TIMESTAMP] [ARCHITECT]: [TASK_READY] TASK-EXXX ready"
  4. CONTINUE your own work immediately (don't wait for Executor)

CRITICAL: Your task must be COMPLETE and SELF-CONTAINED.
          Executor does NOT talk to User. Executor only has YOUR instructions.
          Include EVERYTHING they need to complete the task.
          Only post [TASK_READY] when the task is FULLY WRITTEN.

COMPLETE TASK TEMPLATE FOR EXECUTOR:

```

Post in LIVE_CHAT.md with [Q] prefix. I will respond.
```

================================================================================
3.5 WORKING ON YOUR OWN TASKS
================================================================================

When working on your own tasks (complex work you do yourself):

  BEFORE STARTING:
  [ ] Check LIVE_CHAT.md for any urgent messages or questions
  [ ] Check LOCKED_FILES.md - are the files you need available?
  [ ] Add your locks to LOCKED_FILES.md
  [ ] Post in LIVE_CHAT: "[LOCK] Claimed [files] for [purpose]"
  [ ] Add entry to ACTIVE_TASKS.md

  WHILE WORKING:
  [ ] Check LIVE_CHAT.md between major steps
  [ ] Answer any [Q] questions from Executor
  [ ] Validate any [DONE] tasks from Executor
  [ ] Post [UPDATE] messages for significant progress
  [ ] If blocked, post [BLOCKED] and add to BLOCKERS.md

  AFTER COMPLETING:

  After validation checkpoint:
  1. Post: "[SESSION_COMPLETE] All work done and validated."
  2. Update ROADMAP.md:
     - Mark completed tasks as ✅
     - Update milestone status
     - Add entry to "Session History"

  4. Report to User:
     - What was accomplished (reference milestone)
     - Validation results
     - Any issues found and fixed
     - What's next on the roadmap

================================================================================
3.7 REVIEWING EXECUTOR'S WORK
================================================================================

When Executor marks a task as [DONE]:

  1. Read their completion message in LIVE_CHAT.md
  2. Review the files they changed
  3. Check against the acceptance criteria
  4. Test if applicable

  IF APPROVED:
  - Post: "[TIMESTAMP] [ARCHITECT]: [VALIDATED] TASK-EXXX. Good work."
  - Update COMPLETED_TASKS.md with validation note
  - If significant feature, add to OperationsValidation/VALIDATION_QUEUE.md
  - CONTINUE your own work

  IF ISSUES FOUND:
  - Post: "[TIMESTAMP] [ARCHITECT]: TASK-EXXX needs revision: [specific issues]"
  - Executor will fix and report [DONE] again

================================================================================
4.1 EXECUTOR RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================================================

As the EXECUTOR, you are responsible for:

  1. WAITING: If inbox empty, WAIT and keep checking until tasks appear
  2. EXECUTING: Complete tasks assigned in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  3. FOLLOWING: Follow Architect's instructions precisely
  4. ASKING: If unclear, ask in LIVE_CHAT.md (don't guess)
  5. REPORTING: Keep LIVE_CHAT.md updated with your progress
  6. VALIDATING: Review Architect's completed work when asked
  7. QUALITY: Meet all acceptance criteria before marking [DONE]
  8. CONTINUING: Process ALL tasks, not just the first one

YOU DO NOT communicate with User directly.
YOU receive all orders from Architect via INBOX_EXECUTOR.md.
When User sends "." - you enter CONTINUOUS WORK MODE until [SESSION_COMPLETE].

BATCH MODE BENEFITS:
  ✅ You ALWAYS have work (unless all tasks are done)
  ✅ You NEVER wait for Architect's tasks to complete
  ✅ Internal dependencies (E001→E002) are fine - just order your work
  ✅ No [WAITING_FOR_TASKS] needed - if you're waiting, something is wrong

IF YOU FIND YOURSELF WAITING:
  ────────────────────────────
  If inbox is empty but no [BATCH_READY], wait briefly for the signal.
  If [BATCH_READY] was posted but inbox is empty → [AGENT_ERROR] @USER
  Something went wrong with task creation.

INTERNAL DEPENDENCIES (EXECUTOR→EXECUTOR):
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  If E002 depends on E001:
    1. Work on E001 first (or other independent tasks)
    2. When E001 is [DONE], start E002
    3. This is NORMAL and expected in Batch Mode

================================================================================
4.4 PROCESSING YOUR INBOX
================================================================================

When you find a task in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md:

  1. Check LIVE_CHAT for [TASK_READY] signal for this task
     - If NOT found → Task might still be written, WAIT
     - If FOUND → Task is complete, proceed

  2. Read the ENTIRE task carefully

  3. Check Dependencies - are prerequisite tasks done?
     - If NOT → Wait for them, work on other tasks

  4. Check LOCKED_FILES.md - are needed files available?
     - If NOT → Wait for unlock, work on other tasks

  IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE TASK:
     - Change status from PENDING to IN_PROGRESS
     - Post in LIVE_CHAT: "[TIMESTAMP] [EXECUTOR]: Starting TASK-EXXX."
     - Proceed to execute

  IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS:
     - Post in LIVE_CHAT: "[TIMESTAMP] [EXECUTOR]: [Q] TASK-EXXX: [question]"
     - WAIT for Architect's [A] response before starting
     - Keep checking LIVE_CHAT for the answer

================================================================================
4.5 EXECUTING TASKS
================================================================================

Once you start a task:

  SETUP:
  [ ] Update task status to IN_PROGRESS in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  [ ] Add entry to ACTIVE_TASKS.md
  [ ] Check LOCKED_FILES.md for files you need
  [ ] Add your locks to LOCKED_FILES.md
  [ ] Post in LIVE_CHAT: "[LOCK] Claimed [files] for TASK-EXXX"

  DURING EXECUTION:
  [ ] Follow the Step-by-Step Instructions in the task
  [ ] Check LIVE_CHAT.md between steps for messages
  [ ] Post [UPDATE] for significant progress
  [ ] If stuck, post [Q] and WAIT for [A]
  [ ] If blocked, post [BLOCKED] and work on other tasks

  IMPORTANT: Never guess if instructions are unclear. ASK and WAIT.

================================================================================
4.6 COMPLETING TASKS
================================================================================

When you finish a task:

  COMPLETION CHECKLIST:
  [ ] Verify ALL acceptance criteria are met
  [ ] Run any testing instructions
  [ ] Remove locks from LOCKED_FILES.md
  [ ] Post in LIVE_CHAT: "[UNLOCK] Released [files]"
  [ ] Post in LIVE_CHAT:
      "[TIMESTAMP] [EXECUTOR]: [DONE] TASK-EXXX: [brief summary]"
  [ ] Update task status to COMPLETED in INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  [ ] Remove from ACTIVE_TASKS.md
  [ ] Add to COMPLETED_TASKS.md with details

  THEN IMMEDIATELY:
  [ ] Go back to INBOX_EXECUTOR.md for next task
  [ ] If no more tasks → Enter waiting mode (section 4.7)
  [ ] Do NOT stop working

================================================================================
4.7 WHEN ALL TASKS ARE COMPLETED (BATCH MODE)
================================================================================

In Batch Mode, inbox should never be "empty" unexpectedly.

  NORMAL SITUATION (All tasks done):
  ──────────────────────────────────
  1. You've completed all tasks in your batch
  2. Post: "All Executor tasks complete. [X/X tasks done]"
  3. Wait for [SESSION_COMPLETE] from Architect
  4. Architect may still be working on their own tasks
  5. When [SESSION_COMPLETE] seen → Sign off

  ABNORMAL SITUATION (Empty inbox, no [BATCH_READY]):
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. If inbox is empty but [BATCH_READY] was NOT posted:
     - Architect is still writing tasks
     - Wait briefly for [BATCH_READY] signal
     - Once seen → Start working on tasks

  ERROR SITUATION (Empty inbox after [BATCH_READY]):
  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. If inbox is empty but [BATCH_READY] WAS posted:
     - Something went wrong!
     - Post: "[AGENT_ERROR] @USER Inbox empty after [BATCH_READY]"
     - Wait for User to resolve

================================================================================
4.8 EXECUTOR CHECKLIST (Print This)
================================================================================

WHEN USER SENDS ".":
  [ ] Read LIVE_CHAT.md
  [ ] Post [SYNC] message
  [ ] Enter CONTINUOUS WORK MODE

CONTINUOUS WORK MODE:
  [ ] Check INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  [ ] If tasks with [TASK_READY] → Execute them
  [ ] If tasks without [TASK_READY] → Wait for signal
  [ ] If empty → Post [WAITING_FOR_TASKS], keep checking
  [ ] NEVER stop until [SESSION_COMPLETE]

BEFORE EDITING FILES:
  [ ] Check LOCKED_FILES.md
  [ ] Add your lock
  [ ] Post [LOCK] in LIVE_CHAT

DURING WORK:
  [ ] Check LIVE_CHAT.md between steps
  [ ] Post [UPDATE] for progress
  [ ] Post [Q] if unclear (then WAIT for [A])

AFTER COMPLETING EACH TASK:
  [ ] Verify acceptance criteria met
  [ ] Remove locks from LOCKED_FILES.md
  [ ] Post [UNLOCK] in LIVE_CHAT
  [ ] Post [DONE] in LIVE_CHAT
  [ ] Update task status to COMPLETED
  [ ] Update ACTIVE_TASKS.md
  [ ] Add to COMPLETED_TASKS.md
  [ ] Go back for next task (DON'T STOP)

WHEN [VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT] RECEIVED:
  [ ] STOP new work immediately
  [ ] Validate ALL Architect [DONE] tasks:
      - Read files they created/modified
      - Check for obvious issues or gaps
      - Post [VALIDATED] TASK-AXXX for each passing task
      - Flag concerns if issues found
  [ ] Wait for [VALIDATION_COMPLETE]

SESSION END:
  [ ] Confirm [VALIDATION_COMPLETE] received
  [ ] Confirm [SESSION_COMPLETE] received
  [ ] Post signing off message

IF PROBLEMS:
  [ ] Post [AGENT_ERROR] @USER immediately
  [ ] Post [PROTOCOL_BREAK] if Architect not following protocol
  [ ] STOP and wait for User response

                     PART 5: COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
5.1 LIVE_CHAT.md USAGE
================================================================================

LIVE_CHAT.md is the PRIMARY communication channel.

FORMAT:
  [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] [AGENT]: [PREFIX] Message content

EXAMPLES:
  [2025-12-07 14:30] [ARCHITECT]: [TASK_READY] TASK-E001 ready for Executor.
  [2025-12-07 14:35] [EXECUTOR]: Starting TASK-E001.
  [2025-12-07 15:00] [EXECUTOR]: [DONE] TASK-E001 complete.
  [2025-12-07 15:05] [ARCHITECT]: [VALIDATED] TASK-E001. Good work.
  [2025-12-07 15:30] [ARCHITECT]: [SESSION_COMPLETE] All work done.

WHEN TO POST:
  - Starting work
  - Completing a step
  - Task ready for other agent
  - Asking a question
  - Answering a question
  - Encountering an issue
  - Completing a task
  - Locking/unlocking files
  - Session signals

================================================================================
5.2 MESSAGE PREFIXES
================================================================================

ALWAYS use a prefix. This makes messages scannable.

  ┌──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  PREFIX              │  USE WHEN                                         │

  └──────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────┘

NOTE: [SESSION_COMPLETE] requires [VALIDATION_COMPLETE] first!
      No session ends without checkpoint validation.

================================================================================
5.3 SESSION SIGNALS (BATCH MODE)
================================================================================

These signals control the Batch Mode workflow:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  SIGNAL                  │  FROM      │  MEANING                        │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │  [FILLER_CONFIRM]        │  Architect │  Asking User about filler tasks │
  │  [BATCH_READY]           │  Architect │  ALL Executor tasks defined     │
  │  [TASK_READY] TASK-XXX   │  Architect │  Individual task ready (legacy) │
  │  [ALL_TASKS_ASSIGNED]    │  Architect │  Implicit with [BATCH_READY]    │
  │  [SESSION_COMPLETE]      │  Architect │  Session done, stop working     │
  │  [DECISION_NEEDED]       │  Architect │  User must provide input        │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

BATCH MODE WORKFLOW:

  1. User tells Architect what to build
  2. Architect plans all tasks (Batch Mode planning)
  3. If filler tasks needed → Posts [FILLER_CONFIRM] to User
  4. User confirms (or not)
  5. Architect writes ALL Executor tasks to INBOX_EXECUTOR.md
  6. Architect posts [BATCH_READY] in LIVE_CHAT
  7. User sends "." to Executor
  8. Executor sees [BATCH_READY] → Processes ALL tasks in order
  9. Executor handles internal deps (E001→E002) by ordering work
  10. Executor finishes all → Posts "All Executor tasks complete"
  11. Architect finishes own tasks → Posts [SESSION_COMPLETE]
  12. Everyone stops

KEY DIFFERENCE FROM OLD MODE:
  ❌ OLD: Executor waits mid-session for Architect tasks
  ✅ NEW: Executor NEVER waits for Architect - always has work

================================================================================
5.4 ASKING QUESTIONS
================================================================================

When you need clarification:

  1. Post in LIVE_CHAT with [Q] prefix
  2. Be specific about what you need to know
  3. Reference the task ID if applicable
  4. WAIT for [A] response before proceeding

  GOOD QUESTION:
  [2025-12-07 14:35] [EXECUTOR]: [Q] TASK-E001: Should the Treasury rate cache
  expire after 1 hour or 24 hours?

  BAD QUESTION:
  [2025-12-07 14:35] [EXECUTOR]: [Q] How should I do the caching?

  (Too vague. Be specific about what you're unsure about.)

================================================================================
5.5 STATUS UPDATES
================================================================================

Post [UPDATE] messages to keep the other agent informed.

  WHEN TO POST UPDATES:
  - Starting a new step
  - Completing a step
  - Finding something unexpected
  - Making progress (every 10-15 min of work)

  GOOD UPDATE:
  [2025-12-07 14:45] [EXECUTOR]: [UPDATE] TASK-E001: FRED API connected.
  Testing rate retrieval now.

================================================================================
5.6 THE SYNC PROTOCOL
================================================================================

At the START of every session:

  ARCHITECT:
  [2025-12-07 09:00] [ARCHITECT]: [SYNC] Online. Working on [description].
  Will create Executor tasks as needed.

  EXECUTOR (when User sends "."):
  [2025-12-07 09:05] [EXECUTOR]: [SYNC] Online. Entering continuous mode.
  Will process all tasks until [SESSION_COMPLETE].

================================================================================
5.7 THE STATUS COMMAND
================================================================================

For a quick snapshot of current state:

  REQUEST:
  [2025-12-07 14:00] [ARCHITECT]: [STATUS] Request

  RESPONSE:
  [2025-12-07 14:01] [EXECUTOR]: [STATUS] Dump:
  - Current Task: TASK-E001 Treasury API
  - Status: IN_PROGRESS (70% done)
  - Files Locked: usa_backend.py
  - Blockers: None
  - ETA: 20 minutes
  - Waiting for: Nothing, actively working

5.9 ERROR EXAMPLES
================================================================================

EXAMPLE 1: Executor not responding

  [2025-12-07 14:30] [ARCHITECT]: [PROTOCOL_BREAK] @USER @EXECUTOR
  Issue: Executor has not posted [SYNC] or any message for 20+ minutes
  Expected: Executor should be in continuous mode, checking inbox
  Actual: No activity in LIVE_CHAT since my [TASK_READY] at 14:10
  
EXAMPLE 2: Cannot access files

  [2025-12-07 14:30] [EXECUTOR]: [AGENT_ERROR] @USER
  Problem: Cannot read INBOX_EXECUTOR.md - file appears corrupted/empty
  Impact: Cannot receive tasks, session blocked
  Tried: Re-reading file 3 times
  Need: User to verify file exists and has content

EXAMPLE 3: Task impossible

  [2025-12-07 14:30] [EXECUTOR]: [AGENT_ERROR] @USER
  Problem: TASK-E001 asks to modify file.py but file doesn't exist
  Impact: Cannot complete task
  Tried: Searched for similar filenames
  Need: Architect to clarify correct filename

EXAMPLE 4: Architect not validating

  [2025-12-07 15:00] [EXECUTOR]: [PROTOCOL_BREAK] @USER @ARCHITECT
  Issue: Architect has not validated 3 completed tasks
  Expected: [VALIDATED] or revision request within reasonable time
  Actual: Tasks TASK-E001, E002, E003 all [DONE] but no response

EXAMPLE 5: Session stuck

  [2025-12-07 16:00] [ARCHITECT]: [AGENT_ERROR] @USER
  Problem: Session not progressing - both agents waiting for each other
  Impact: No work being done
  Tried: Posted [STATUS] request, no response
  Need: User to restart Executor or clarify workflow

================================================================================
5.10 USER RESPONSE TO ERRORS
================================================================================

When you see [AGENT_ERROR] or [PROTOCOL_BREAK]:

  1. Read the error details
  2. Respond to the affected agent with guidance
  3. If needed, restart the other agent
  4. Confirm when issue is resolved

COMMON FIXES:
  - Agent not responding → Send "." to restart Executor, or talk to Architect
  - File issues → Verify files exist and are readable
  - Protocol violations → Remind agent of correct protocol
  - Stuck session → Issue new instructions to Architect

================================================================================
                      PART 6: FILE LOCKING
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
6.1 WHY LOCK FILES
================================================================================

If two agents edit the same file simultaneously, changes can conflict.
File locking prevents this by ensuring only ONE agent edits a file at a time.

================================================================================
6.2 HOW TO LOCK
================================================================================

BEFORE editing any code file:

  1. Open LOCKED_FILES.md
  2. Check if the file is already locked
  3. If NOT locked, add your entry:

     | filepath.py | ARCHITECT | 2025-12-07 14:30 | Adding X feature | ~1 hour |

  4. Post in LIVE_CHAT:
     [2025-12-07 14:30] [ARCHITECT]: [LOCK] Claimed filepath.py for X feature.

  5. Now you can safely edit the file

================================================================================
6.3 HOW TO UNLOCK
================================================================================

AFTER you finish editing:

  1. Open LOCKED_FILES.md
  2. Remove your entry
  3. Post in LIVE_CHAT:
     [2025-12-07 15:00] [ARCHITECT]: [UNLOCK] Released filepath.py.

================================================================================
6.4 CONFLICT RESOLUTION
================================================================================

If a file you need is locked:

  OPTION 1: Wait and work on something else
  - Check LIVE_CHAT for unlock message
  - Work on another task meanwhile
  - Keep checking periodically

  OPTION 2: Coordinate
  - Post in LIVE_CHAT: "Need access to [file]. Can you release soon?"
  - Wait for response

  OPTION 3: Emergency Override (use rarely)
  - If other agent unresponsive for 30+ minutes
  - Post: "[FORCE_UNLOCK] Taking [file] - [urgent reason]"
  - Remove their lock, add yours

```

================================================================================
7.2 TASK LIFECYCLE
================================================================================

  PENDING ──► IN_PROGRESS ──► COMPLETED ──► VALIDATED
                  │
                  ▼
               BLOCKED ──► (resolve) ──► IN_PROGRESS

  PENDING:      Task created, [TASK_READY] signal sent
  IN_PROGRESS:  Currently being worked on
  BLOCKED:      Cannot proceed, waiting for something
  COMPLETED:    Work done, awaiting validation
  VALIDATED:    Other agent confirmed it's good

================================================================================
7.3 DEPENDENCIES
================================================================================

Tasks can depend on other tasks:

  **Depends On:** TASK-A001, TASK-E002
  **Blocks:** TASK-E005

  DEPENDS ON: This task cannot start until listed tasks are COMPLETED.
  BLOCKS: These tasks are waiting for THIS task to complete.

Check dependencies before starting. If not met, work on something else.

================================================================================
7.4 HANDOFFS
================================================================================

When transferring work to another agent:

  1. Document current state in the task's "Current State" section:
     - What's already done
     - What remains
     - Any gotchas or notes

  2. Post in LIVE_CHAT:
     [2025-12-07 15:00] [ARCHITECT]: [HANDOFF] TASK-E001 to Executor.
     Context: API connected, needs caching implementation.

  3. Update ACTIVE_TASKS.md to show new owner

================================================================================
7.5 BLOCKED TASKS
================================================================================

When you cannot proceed:

  1. Update task status to BLOCKED
  2. Add entry to CONTEXT/BLOCKERS.md
  3. Post in LIVE_CHAT:
     [2025-12-07 15:00] [EXECUTOR]: [BLOCKED] TASK-E001: Need API key.
     Added to BLOCKERS.md.
  4. Work on a different task (DON'T STOP WORKING)
  5. Check back later for resolution

                   PART 8: VALIDATION & COMPLETION
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
8.1 CROSS-VALIDATION PROTOCOL
================================================================================

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF VALIDATION:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  TYPE 1: INLINE VALIDATION (Optional - During Work)                     │
  │  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════                    │
  │                                                                         │
  │  When the other agent posts [DONE], you MAY validate between your       │
  │  own tasks. This is optional during Batch Mode to maintain speed.       │
  │                                                                         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  TYPE 2: CHECKPOINT VALIDATION (REQUIRED - At Milestone End)            │
  │  ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════             │
  │                                                                         │
  │  Before posting [SESSION_COMPLETE], BOTH agents MUST:                   │
  │                                                                         │
  │  1. STOP all new work                                                   │
  │  2. Architect posts: "[VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT]"                          │
  │  3. EACH agent validates ALL of the OTHER agent's completed tasks       │
  │  4. Post [VALIDATED] for each task that passes                          │
  │  5. Request revision for any issues found                               │
  │  6. Fix issues and re-validate                                          │
  │  7. Post: "[VALIDATION_COMPLETE] X/X tasks passed"                      │
  │  8. ONLY THEN can Architect post [SESSION_COMPLETE]                     │
  │                                                                         │
  │  THIS IS MANDATORY. No session ends without checkpoint validation.      │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  WHAT TO CHECK DURING VALIDATION:
  ─────────────────────────────────
  - Files created/modified exist and are correct
  - Acceptance criteria from task are met
  - No obvious bugs or gaps
  - Code follows project patterns
  - Research docs are complete and accurate
  - Tests pass (if applicable)
  - **TESTING STANDARDS MET** (see section 8.4)

  IF APPROVED:
  Post: "[VALIDATED] TASK-EXXX. [Brief note on what you checked]"

  IF ISSUES FOUND:
  Post: "TASK-EXXX needs revision: [specific issues]"
  Original agent fixes → Reports [DONE] again → Re-validate

================================================================================
8.4 TESTING STANDARDS (MANDATORY)
================================================================================

ALL features must pass COMPREHENSIVE testing before [SESSION_COMPLETE].
Testing "does it run" is NOT enough. You must test "is it ACCURATE".

                         PART 9: EXAMPLES
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
9.1 COMPLETE AUTONOMOUS WORKFLOW
================================================================================

This shows how both agents work continuously with minimal User intervention.

USER → ARCHITECT: "Add Treasury rate API and industry benchmarks to DCF"

ARCHITECT reads request, plans work, posts:
  [2025-12-07 10:00] [ARCHITECT]: [SYNC] Online. Working on DCF improvements.
  Will create Executor tasks for API work, handling benchmarks myself.

USER → EXECUTOR: "."

EXECUTOR starts:
  [2025-12-07 10:01] [EXECUTOR]: [SYNC] Online. Entering continuous mode.
  [2025-12-07 10:01] [EXECUTOR]: [WAITING_FOR_TASKS] Inbox empty. Standing by.

ARCHITECT creates first task, continues own work:
  [2025-12-07 10:05] [ARCHITECT]: [TASK_READY] TASK-E001 (Treasury API) ready.
  [2025-12-07 10:05] [ARCHITECT]: [LOCK] Claimed dcf_modeling.py for benchmarks.

EXECUTOR sees [TASK_READY], works:
  [2025-12-07 10:06] [EXECUTOR]: Starting TASK-E001.
  [2025-12-07 10:06] [EXECUTOR]: [LOCK] Claimed usa_backend.py for Treasury API.
  [2025-12-07 10:20] [EXECUTOR]: [UPDATE] FRED API connected, implementing cache.

ARCHITECT continues, creates another task:
  [2025-12-07 10:25] [ARCHITECT]: [TASK_READY] TASK-E002 (Data validation) ready.
  [2025-12-07 10:30] [ARCHITECT]: [UPDATE] Industry benchmarks 50% done.

EXECUTOR finishes first, moves to second:
  [2025-12-07 10:35] [EXECUTOR]: [UNLOCK] Released usa_backend.py.
  [2025-12-07 10:35] [EXECUTOR]: [DONE] TASK-E001 complete. API working, cached.
  [2025-12-07 10:36] [EXECUTOR]: Starting TASK-E002.
  [2025-12-07 10:36] [EXECUTOR]: [LOCK] Claimed validation_engine.py.

ARCHITECT validates while working:
  [2025-12-07 10:40] [ARCHITECT]: [VALIDATED] TASK-E001. Good work.
  [2025-12-07 10:45] [ARCHITECT]: [DONE] Industry benchmarks complete.
  [2025-12-07 10:45] [ARCHITECT]: [UNLOCK] Released dcf_modeling.py.
  [2025-12-07 10:45] [ARCHITECT]: [ALL_TASKS_ASSIGNED] No more Executor tasks.

EXECUTOR finishes remaining:
  [2025-12-07 11:00] [EXECUTOR]: [UNLOCK] Released validation_engine.py.
  [2025-12-07 11:00] [EXECUTOR]: [DONE] TASK-E002 complete.
  [2025-12-07 11:01] [EXECUTOR]: All assigned tasks complete. Awaiting session end.

ARCHITECT validates and ends:
  [2025-12-07 11:05] [ARCHITECT]: [VALIDATED] TASK-E002. All looks good.
  [2025-12-07 11:05] [ARCHITECT]: [SESSION_COMPLETE] All DCF work done.

EXECUTOR signs off:
  [2025-12-07 11:06] [EXECUTOR]: [SYNC] Session complete. Signing off.

ARCHITECT reports to USER:
  "Session complete. Added Treasury API (dynamic WACC) and industry benchmarks.
   2 tasks delegated to Executor, both validated. Ready for R&D review."

================================================================================
9.2 EXECUTOR WAITING FOR TASKS EXAMPLE
================================================================================

Shows what happens when Executor starts before Architect has tasks ready.

USER → EXECUTOR: "."

EXECUTOR:
  [2025-12-07 10:00] [EXECUTOR]: [SYNC] Online. Entering continuous mode.
  [2025-12-07 10:00] [EXECUTOR]: Checking inbox...
  [2025-12-07 10:00] [EXECUTOR]: [WAITING_FOR_TASKS] Inbox empty. Standing by.

  (Executor waits, periodically checks inbox)

  [2025-12-07 10:03] [EXECUTOR]: Still waiting for tasks...

ARCHITECT (working on planning):
  [2025-12-07 10:05] [ARCHITECT]: [TASK_READY] TASK-E001 ready.

EXECUTOR (sees it):
  [2025-12-07 10:05] [EXECUTOR]: Task found! Starting TASK-E001.

  (Executor proceeds normally)

================================================================================
9.3 QUESTION-ANSWER EXAMPLE
================================================================================

EXECUTOR needs clarification (doesn't stop working, just asks):

  [2025-12-07 10:20] [EXECUTOR]: [Q] TASK-E001: The existing cache uses
  _cache_ttl dict. Should I add a new "treasury_rate" key with 3600 seconds,
  or reuse "market_data" which is also 3600?

  (Executor can work on non-blocked parts while waiting)

ARCHITECT responds (while continuing own work):
  [2025-12-07 10:22] [ARCHITECT]: [A] Add new "treasury_rate" key. Cleaner and
  lets us adjust it independently later.

EXECUTOR continues:
  [2025-12-07 10:22] [EXECUTOR]: Got it. Proceeding with new key.

                       PART 10: QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================
================================================================================

================================================================================
10.1 ARCHITECT QUICK REFERENCE (BATCH MODE)
================================================================================

SESSION:
  1. Read all relevant files
  2. Plan BATCH MODE (no cross-dependencies!)
  3. If filler needed → Ask User: [FILLER_CONFIRM]
  4. Write ALL Executor tasks to inbox
  5. Post [BATCH_READY]
  6. Post [SYNC]
  7. Work CONTINUOUSLY on your own tasks
  
SESSION END (CHECKPOINT VALIDATION + TESTING):
  8. Post [VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT] - stop new work
  9. Validate ALL Executor tasks → Post [VALIDATED] each
  10. Wait for Executor to validate your tasks
  11. Post [VALIDATION_COMPLETE] X/X passed
  12. Run pytest suite + accuracy tests
  13. Post [TESTING_REPORT] (see 8.4 for format)
  14. Post [SESSION_COMPLETE]
  15. Report to User

RULES:
  ✅ Executor tasks can depend on Executor tasks (E001→E002)
  ✅ Your tasks can depend on Executor tasks (E005→A003)
  ❌ Executor tasks CANNOT depend on your tasks
  ❌ No [SESSION_COMPLETE] without [VALIDATION_COMPLETE]

================================================================================
10.2 EXECUTOR QUICK REFERENCE (BATCH MODE)
================================================================================

WHEN USER SENDS ".":
  1. Post [SYNC]
  2. Check LIVE_CHAT for [BATCH_READY]
  3. If [BATCH_READY] → ALL tasks are defined, start working!
  4. If NOT [BATCH_READY] → Wait briefly for signal
  5. Check INBOX_EXECUTOR.md for tasks
  6. Handle internal dependencies (E001→E002) by ordering work
  7. Process ALL tasks in priority order
  8. When all done → Post "All Executor tasks complete"

WHEN [VALIDATION_CHECKPOINT] RECEIVED:
  9. STOP new work
  10. Validate ALL Architect tasks → Post [VALIDATED] each
  11. Wait for [VALIDATION_COMPLETE]
  12. Wait for [SESSION_COMPLETE] → Sign off

KEY RULES:
  ✅ You ALWAYS have work (no waiting for Architect)
  ✅ All tasks defined upfront
  ✅ MUST validate Architect's work at checkpoint

                            PART 12: FAQ (BATCH MODE)
================================================================================
================================================================================

Q: What if Executor sends "." before Architect has any tasks?
A: Executor waits for [BATCH_READY] signal. Once seen, all tasks are defined
   and Executor can start working. This wait is brief and expected.

Q: How does Executor know when to stop?
A: Executor stops when [SESSION_COMPLETE] is seen AND all their tasks are done.

Q: What if a task in the inbox depends on an Architect task?
A: THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN BATCH MODE! Architect must restructure.
   Executor tasks can only depend on OTHER Executor tasks (E001→E002).
   If you see this, post [PROTOCOL_BREAK] @USER @ARCHITECT.

Q: What if both agents need the same file?
A: Higher priority task gets it. Same priority = Architect decides.
   Post in LIVE_CHAT to coordinate.

Q: What if the other agent isn't responding?
A: Check if they're active. If inactive 30+ min, you can [FORCE_UNLOCK] files
   and proceed. Document it.

Q: What if a task is too complex for Executor?
A: Executor posts [Q] asking for clarification or breakdown.
   Architect can split it or take it back.

Q: When should Architect post [BATCH_READY]?
A: After ALL Executor tasks are written to INBOX_EXECUTOR.md.
   This is the signal for Executor to start. No more tasks will be added.

Q: When should Architect post [SESSION_COMPLETE]?
A: When ALL work is done - both Architect's own work AND all Executor
   tasks validated. This ends the session.

Q: What are "filler tasks"?
A: Low-priority tasks from ROADMAP.md that Architect adds if Executor
   would otherwise finish too early. Architect asks User for confirmation
   before adding them: [FILLER_CONFIRM] "Adding X, Y, Z. OK?"

Q: Can User send multiple "." to Executor?
A: Not needed. One "." starts continuous mode. Executor works until
   [SESSION_COMPLETE]. Only send another "." if starting a new session.

Q: What if Executor finishes before Architect?
A: Normal! Executor posts "All Executor tasks complete" and waits for
   [SESSION_COMPLETE]. Architect may still be working on complex tasks.
