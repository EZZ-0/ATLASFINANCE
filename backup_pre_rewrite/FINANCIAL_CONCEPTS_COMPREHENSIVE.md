## SECTION 1: VALUATION FUNDAMENTALS

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

DCF Core Principle:
A company's value = present value of all future cash flows it will generate

Formula:
Enterprise Value = Sum of [FCF_t / (1 + WACC)^t] + Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^n

Where:
- FCF_t = Free Cash Flow in year t
- WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital (discount rate)
- t = time period
- n = forecast period (typically 5-10 years)

### Free Cash Flow (FCF)

Definition: Cash generated by operations available to all investors (debt and equity)

Calculation Methods:

Method 1 (Operating approach):
FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

Method 2 (From net income):
FCF = Net Income
    + Depreciation & Amortization (non-cash)
    + Interest Expense x (1 - Tax Rate)
    - Change in Net Working Capital
    - Capital Expenditures

Method 3 (Unlevered FCF):
FCF = EBIT x (1 - Tax Rate)
    + Depreciation & Amortization
    - Change in Net Working Capital
    - Capital Expenditures

Why FCF Matters:
Cash flow > accounting profit. Companies can manipulate earnings, but cash is real.

### Terminal Value

Definition: Value of all cash flows beyond the explicit forecast period (represents 60-80% of total DCF value)

Calculation Methods:

1. Perpetuity Growth Method:
Terminal Value = FCF_final x (1 + g) / (WACC - g)

Where g = perpetual growth rate (typically 2-3%, matching GDP growth)

2. Exit Multiple Method:
Terminal Value = EBITDA_final x Exit Multiple

Common exit multiples: 8-12x EBITDA for mature companies

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

Definition: Average rate a company pays to finance its assets, weighted by capital structure

Formula:
WACC = (E/V) x Re + (D/V) x Rd x (1 - Tc)

Where:
- E = Market value of equity
- D = Market value of debt
- V = E + D (total value)
- Re = Cost of equity
- Rd = Cost of debt
- Tc = Corporate tax rate

Cost of Equity Calculation (CAPM):
Re = Rf + Beta x (Rm - Rf)

Where:
- Rf = Risk-free rate (10-year Treasury yield, typically 3-5%)
- Beta = Stock volatility relative to market (1.0 = market average)
- Rm = Expected market return (historical average ~10%)
- (Rm - Rf) = Equity risk premium (typically 5-7%)

Cost of Debt Calculation:
Rd = Interest Expense / Total Debt

Or use yield-to-maturity on company bonds

Tax Shield:
Companies deduct interest expense from taxes, so debt is cheaper than equity
Effective cost = Rd x (1 - Tax Rate)

### Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value

Enterprise Value (EV):
Market value of entire business (all investors)
EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash

Equity Value:
Market value of shareholders' stake only
Equity Value = Market Cap = Share Price x Shares Outstanding

Bridge:
Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt + Non-Operating Assets

Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash

Why It Matters:
- DCF produces Enterprise Value
- To get price per share, convert to Equity Value
- Debt holders have priority claim before equity

---

## SECTION 2: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

### Income Statement

Purpose: Shows profitability over a period

Key Line Items:
1. Revenue (Top Line)
   - Total sales of goods/services

2. Cost of Revenue / COGS
   - Direct costs to produce goods sold

3. Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS
   - Profit before operating expenses

4. Operating Expenses
   - R&D (Research & Development)
   - SG&A (Selling, General & Administrative)

5. Operating Income (EBIT) = Gross Profit - OpEx
   - Earnings Before Interest and Taxes
   - Measures operating performance

6. Interest Expense
   - Cost of debt

7. Pre-Tax Income = EBIT - Interest

8. Income Tax Expense = Pre-Tax Income x Tax Rate

9. Net Income (Bottom Line) = Pre-Tax Income - Taxes
   - Profit available to shareholders

Key Ratios:
- Gross Margin = Gross Profit / Revenue
- Operating Margin = EBIT / Revenue  
- Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue

### Balance Sheet

Purpose: Snapshot of financial position at a point in time

Structure:
Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity

Assets (what company owns):

Current Assets (converted to cash within 1 year):
- Cash and Cash Equivalents
- Accounts Receivable (money owed by customers)
- Inventory
- Other Current Assets

Non-Current Assets:
- Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E)
- Intangible Assets (patents, goodwill)
- Long-term Investments

Liabilities (what company owes):

Current Liabilities (due within 1 year):
- Accounts Payable (money owed to suppliers)
- Short-term Debt
- Accrued Expenses

Non-Current Liabilities:
- Long-term Debt
- Deferred Tax Liabilities
- Pension Obligations

Shareholders' Equity:
- Common Stock
- Retained Earnings (accumulated profits)
- Treasury Stock (buybacks)

Key Concepts:
- Liquidity: Can company pay short-term obligations?
- Solvency: Can company pay long-term obligations?
- Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

### Cash Flow Statement

Purpose: Tracks actual cash movements (vs. accrual accounting)

Three Sections:

1. Operating Activities (CFO)
   Starts with Net Income, adjusts for:
   - Add back: Depreciation, Amortization (non-cash)
   - Subtract: Increases in Current Assets
   - Add: Increases in Current Liabilities
   
   Result: Cash from core business operations

2. Investing Activities (CFI)
   - Capital Expenditures (CapEx) - cash spent on PP&E
   - Acquisitions
   - Sale of assets
   - Investment purchases/sales
   
   Typically negative (companies invest in growth)

3. Financing Activities (CFF)
   - Debt issuance/repayment
   - Equity issuance/buybacks
   - Dividends paid
   
   Shows how company raises and returns capital

Reconciliation:
Net Change in Cash = CFO + CFI + CFF

Critical Insight:
A company can be profitable (positive net income) but cash-flow negative (burning cash). Cash flow is reality.

## SECTION 3: FINANCIAL RATIOS

### Profitability Ratios

Return on Equity (ROE):
ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
Measures return to shareholders
Good: >15%, Excellent: >20%

Return on Assets (ROA):
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
Measures efficiency of asset use
Good: >5%, Excellent: >10%

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):
ROIC = NOPAT / Invested Capital
Where NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax
Invested Capital = Debt + Equity - Cash

Measures return on all capital (debt + equity)
Good: >10%, Excellent: >15%
Critical: ROIC > WACC means value creation

### Leverage Ratios

Debt-to-Equity:
D/E = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
Measures financial leverage
Low: <0.5, Moderate: 0.5-1.5, High: >2.0

Debt-to-EBITDA:
Debt / EBITDA
Measures debt relative to cash generation
Good: <3x, Concerning: >4x

Interest Coverage:
EBIT / Interest Expense
Can company pay interest?
Safe: >3x, Risky: <2x

### Liquidity Ratios

Current Ratio:
Current Assets / Current Liabilities
Can company pay short-term bills?
Healthy: >1.5, Risky: <1.0

Quick Ratio (Acid Test):
(Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
More conservative (inventory may not be liquid)
Healthy: >1.0

### Efficiency Ratios

Asset Turnover:
Revenue / Total Assets
How efficiently assets generate sales
Higher = better (industry dependent)

Inventory Turnover:
COGS / Average Inventory
How fast inventory is sold
Higher = better (less capital tied up)

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):
(Accounts Receivable / Revenue) x 365
How long to collect payment
Lower = better (faster cash collection)

### Valuation Multiples

Price-to-Earnings (P/E):
Stock Price / Earnings Per Share
Or: Market Cap / Net Income

Interpretation:
Low P/E (<15): Undervalued or declining business
Average P/E (15-25): Fairly valued
High P/E (>25): Growth expectations or overvalued

Price-to-Book (P/B):
Market Cap / Book Value of Equity
<1.0: Trading below liquidation value
>3.0: Intangible-heavy or growth company

Enterprise Value / EBITDA:
EV / EBITDA
Common for M&A and comparables
Typical range: 8-15x
<8x: Cheap, >20x: Expensive or high-growth

Price-to-Sales (P/S):
Market Cap / Revenue
Useful for unprofitable companies
<1x: Very cheap, >5x: Premium valuation

EV / FCF:
Enterprise Value / Free Cash Flow
Similar to P/E but uses cash vs. earnings
<10x: Cheap, >20x: Expensive

## SECTION 4: FORENSIC ACCOUNTING

### Beneish M-Score (Earnings Manipulation Detection)

Purpose: Statistical model to detect earnings manipulation

Formula: 8 financial ratios combined
M-Score = -4.84 + 0.92*DSRI + 0.528*GMI + 0.404*AQI + 0.892*SGI + 0.115*DEPI - 0.172*SGAI + 4.679*TATA - 0.327*LVGI

Components:

1. DSRI (Days Sales in Receivables Index)
   = (Receivables_t / Sales_t) / (Receivables_t-1 / Sales_t-1)
   >1.0: Revenue recognition issues (recording sales before cash)

2. GMI (Gross Margin Index)
   = Gross Margin_t-1 / Gross Margin_t
   >1.0: Declining margins (deteriorating fundamentals)

3. AQI (Asset Quality Index)
   = Asset Quality_t / Asset Quality_t-1
   Where Asset Quality = (Current Assets + PP&E) / Total Assets
   >1.0: Increasing soft assets (potential capitalization of expenses)

4. SGI (Sales Growth Index)
   = Sales_t / Sales_t-1
   >1.0: High growth (pressure to maintain, incentive to manipulate)

5. DEPI (Depreciation Index)
   = Depreciation Rate_t-1 / Depreciation Rate_t
   >1.0: Slowing depreciation (extending asset lives to boost earnings)

6. SGAI (Sales, General & Admin Index)
   = (SGA_t / Sales_t) / (SGA_t-1 / Sales_t-1)
   >1.0: Increasing admin costs (operational inefficiency)

7. TATA (Total Accruals to Total Assets)
   = (Income from Continuing Operations - Cash from Operations) / Total Assets
   Higher values: Earnings driven by accruals, not cash

8. LVGI (Leverage Index)
   = Leverage_t / Leverage_t-1
   >1.0: Increasing debt

Interpretation:
M-Score > -1.78: High probability of manipulation
M-Score < -1.78: Likely legitimate

Red Flags: Companies like Enron, WorldCom scored >-1.78 before collapse

### Altman Z-Score (Bankruptcy Prediction)

Purpose: Predicts likelihood of bankruptcy within 2 years

Formula:
Z = 1.2*X1 + 1.4*X2 + 3.3*X3 + 0.6*X4 + 1.0*X5

Components:

X1 = Working Capital / Total Assets
Measures liquidity

X2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
Measures accumulated profitability

X3 = EBIT / Total Assets
Measures operating efficiency

X4 = Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Total Liabilities
Measures solvency buffer

X5 = Sales / Total Assets
Measures asset turnover

Interpretation:
Z > 2.99: Safe zone (low bankruptcy risk)
1.81 < Z < 2.99: Gray zone (some risk)
Z < 1.81: Distress zone (high bankruptcy risk)

Accuracy: 80-90% for predicting bankruptcy 2 years out

### Piotroski F-Score (Financial Strength)

Purpose: Identify financially strong vs. weak companies (quality screen)

Components (9 binary signals, 0 or 1):

Profitability (4 signals):
1. ROA > 0 (positive return)
2. Operating Cash Flow > 0 (cash-generative)
3. ROA increasing (improving profitability)
4. Cash Flow > Net Income (quality of earnings)

Leverage/Liquidity (3 signals):
5. Decreasing Long-term Debt (deleveraging)
6. Increasing Current Ratio (improving liquidity)
7. No new equity issuance (not diluting)

Operating Efficiency (2 signals):
8. Increasing Gross Margin (pricing power or efficiency)
9. Increasing Asset Turnover (better asset use)

Interpretation:
F-Score 8-9: Strong company (buy signal)
F-Score 6-7: Average
F-Score 0-2: Weak company (avoid/short)

Strategy: Buy high F-Score stocks, short low F-Score stocks (value investing filter)

   - Medium-term (6-18 months)
   - Long-term (18+ months)

10. The Ask
    - Specific action requested
    - Position size recommendation
    - Entry strategy (gradual vs. immediate)

Critical Success Factors:
- Answer "Why Now?" (timing)
- Show conviction but acknowledge risks
- Quantify everything (no vague statements)
- Provide clear action items

### Scenario Analysis

Purpose: Model different outcomes, assess risk/return

Standard Scenarios:

Bear Case:
- Revenue growth: Conservative (e.g., 2-5%)
- Margin compression
- Higher discount rate (add 1-2% to WACC)
- Lower terminal growth (e.g., 1-2%)
- Result: Downside price target

Base Case:
- Consensus expectations
- Historical growth rates
- Current margins sustained
- Standard WACC
- GDP-level terminal growth (2-3%)
- Result: Fair value estimate

Bull Case:
- Optimistic revenue growth (e.g., 10-15%)
- Margin expansion
- Lower discount rate
- Higher terminal growth (e.g., 3-4%)
- Result: Upside price target

Probability Weighting (Optional):
Expected Value = 0.25*Bear + 0.50*Base + 0.25*Bull

Risk/Reward Assessment:
Upside = (Bull - Current Price) / Current Price
Downside = (Current Price - Bear) / Current Price

Asymmetric opportunity: Upside > 2x Downside

### Comparable Company Analysis ("Comps")

Purpose: Value company relative to similar companies

Process:

1. Select Peers
   - Same industry
   - Similar size (market cap within 2-5x)
   - Similar business model
   - Similar growth profile

2. Calculate Multiples
   - P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, P/B
   - Forward vs. Trailing (use forward for growth)

3. Find Median/Average
   - Use median (less skewed by outliers)

4. Apply to Target Company
   - Target EV = Median Multiple x Target EBITDA
   - Implied Price = (Target EV - Net Debt) / Shares

5. Assess Premium/Discount
   - Is target trading above/below peers?
   - Justified by superior metrics? (higher growth, margins, ROIC)

Limitations:
- Assumes market correctly values peers
- Industry-wide mispricing possible
- Not all differences captured by multiples

## SECTION 6: TECHNICAL CONCEPTS

### Market Capitalization Tiers

Mega Cap: >$200B (Apple, Microsoft, Google)
Large Cap: $10B - $200B (Most S&P 500)
Mid Cap: $2B - $10B (Higher growth, more volatile)
Small Cap: $300M - $2B (Risky, high potential)
Micro Cap: $50M - $300M (Very risky, illiquid)
Nano Cap: <$50M (Extremely risky, often scams)

### Beta

Definition: Measure of stock volatility relative to market

Calculation: Covariance(Stock Returns, Market Returns) / Variance(Market Returns)

Interpretation:
Beta = 1.0: Moves with market (average risk)
Beta > 1.0: More volatile than market (e.g., tech stocks, Beta = 1.3)
Beta < 1.0: Less volatile (e.g., utilities, Beta = 0.7)
Beta < 0: Moves opposite to market (rare, e.g., gold)

Used in CAPM for cost of equity

### Tax Shield

Concept: Interest expense is tax-deductible, reducing effective cost of debt

Calculation:
Tax Shield Value = Interest Expense x Tax Rate

Example:
$1M interest at 30% tax rate = $300k tax savings
Effective interest cost = $700k

Why It Matters:
- Debt is cheaper than equity (after-tax)
- Companies use leverage to reduce WACC
- Too much debt = bankruptcy risk (trade-off)

### Net Working Capital (NWC)

Definition: Short-term operating liquidity

Calculation:
NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Or (operating definition):
NWC = (Accounts Receivable + Inventory) - Accounts Payable

Change in NWC in Cash Flow:
Increase in NWC = Cash outflow (more cash tied up)
Decrease in NWC = Cash inflow (cash released)

Example:
If receivables increase $1M (customers pay slower), cash flow decreases $1M

### EBITDA

Definition: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization

Calculation:
EBITDA = Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization

Or:
EBITDA = Operating Income + Depreciation + Amortization

Purpose:
- Proxy for operating cash flow
- Removes capital structure effects (interest)
- Removes accounting choices (depreciation methods)
- Common in M&A and debt covenants

Criticism:
- Ignores CapEx (real cash outflow)
- Can mask poor cash generation
- "Earnings before all the bad stuff"

### Revenue Recognition

Concept: When to record revenue (accrual accounting)

Rules (ASC 606):
1. Identify contract with customer
2. Identify performance obligations
3. Determine transaction price
4. Allocate price to obligations
5. Recognize revenue when obligation satisfied

Issues:
- Subscription revenue (recognize ratably over time)
- Long-term contracts (percentage-of-completion)
- Returns and refunds (must estimate)

Manipulation Red Flags:
- Revenue growth >> customer growth (pulling forward?)
- Accounts Receivable growth >> Revenue growth (uncollectible?)
- Channel stuffing (forcing distributors to buy)

### Capital Expenditures (CapEx)

Definition: Cash spent on long-term assets (PP&E)

Types:
Maintenance CapEx: Replace existing assets (keep business running)
Growth CapEx: Expand capacity (new factories, equipment)

In DCF:
Higher CapEx = Lower FCF (cash consumed)

CapEx Intensity:
CapEx / Revenue
Capital-intensive industries (manufacturing, telecom): >5%
Asset-light (software): <1%

### Depreciation & Amortization

Depreciation: Systematic allocation of tangible asset cost over useful life
Amortization: Same, but for intangible assets

Purpose: Match expense to revenue generated (matching principle)

Methods:
Straight-Line: Equal expense each year (most common)
Accelerated: Higher expense early years (reflects usage)

Non-Cash Expense:
- Reduces net income (tax benefit)
- But doesn't affect cash flow
- Add back in FCF calculation

Manipulation:
Companies can extend useful lives to reduce depreciation and boost earnings

---

## SECTION 7: SECTOR-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

### Technology Companies

Key Metrics:
- Revenue growth (YoY)
- Gross margin (should be 60-80% for software)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) vs. Lifetime value (LTV)
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Net revenue retention (existing customer growth)
- Rule of 40: Growth Rate + FCF Margin should be >40%

Valuation:
- Often unprofitable in growth phase
- P/S multiple more relevant than P/E
- Focus on unit economics and path to profitability

### Financial Institutions (Banks)

Key Metrics:
- Net Interest Margin (NIM): (Interest Income - Interest Expense) / Earning Assets
- Return on Equity (ROE) - critical for banks (target >10%)
- Efficiency Ratio: Non-Interest Expenses / Revenue (lower = better, target <60%)
- Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Core capital / Risk-Weighted Assets (regulatory requirement >6%)
- Loan-to-Deposit Ratio: Loans / Deposits (liquidity measure)
- Non-Performing Loan Ratio: Bad Loans / Total Loans (asset quality)

Valuation:
- P/B ratio most common (target 1.0-2.0x)
- DCF challenging due to leverage and regulatory capital

### Consumer Retail

Key Metrics:
- Same-Store Sales (SSS) growth: Revenue growth in existing stores (removes new store effect)
- Average Transaction Value (ATV)
- Customer traffic (foot traffic or web visits)
- Inventory turnover
- Gross margin (product markup)
- SG&A as % of revenue (operating leverage)

Valuation:
- P/E and EV/EBITDA common
- Focus on comparable store growth and margin trends

### Energy & Commodities

Key Metrics:
- Production volume (barrels/day, tons, etc.)
- Realized price (actual selling price vs. benchmark)
- All-in cost: Production cost + exploration + G&A
- Reserve life: Proven reserves / Annual production (years left)
- Breakeven price: Price needed to cover costs

Valuation:
- Highly cyclical (commodity price dependent)
- P/B and P/CF more stable than P/E
- NAV (Net Asset Value) of reserves

---

## SECTION 8: MARKET STRUCTURE

### Primary vs. Secondary Markets

Primary Market:
- Companies issue NEW securities
- IPO (Initial Public Offering), bond issuance
- Capital flows to company

Secondary Market:
- Investors trade EXISTING securities
- NYSE, NASDAQ
- Capital flows between investors (not to company)

### Market Orders vs. Limit Orders

Market Order:
- Execute immediately at current market price
- Guaranteed execution, but price uncertain
- Use for liquid stocks

Limit Order:
- Execute only at specified price or better
- Guaranteed price, but execution uncertain
- Use for illiquid stocks or volatile markets

### Bid-Ask Spread

Bid: Highest price buyers will pay
Ask: Lowest price sellers will accept
Spread: Ask - Bid

Liquid stocks: Tight spread ($0.01 for AAPL)
Illiquid stocks: Wide spread (can be $1+ for small caps)

Spread = Transaction cost (implicit)

### Stock Splits

Purpose: Reduce share price to make stock more accessible

Example: 2-for-1 split
Before: 100 shares at $200 = $20,000
After: 200 shares at $100 = $20,000

No value change (just more slices of same pie)

Reverse Split: Combines shares (1-for-10)
Often done to avoid delisting (NYSE minimum $1/share)
Red flag: Struggling company

### Dividends vs. Buybacks

Dividends:
- Cash paid to shareholders (per share)
- Taxed as income (15-20% qualified dividend rate)
- Committed (hard to cut without stock crash)

Buybacks:
- Company repurchases own shares
- Reduces share count, increases EPS
- Tax-efficient (only taxed when you sell)
- Flexible (can stop without penalty)

Modern preference: Buybacks (more flexibility, better tax treatment)

### Short Selling

Process:
1. Borrow shares from broker
2. Sell borrowed shares at current price
3. Wait for price to drop
4. Buy back shares at lower price
5. Return shares to broker
6. Keep difference as profit

Risk: Unlimited (price can rise infinitely)

Short Squeeze: If price rises, shorts forced to buy back (covering), driving price higher

---

## SECTION 9: REGULATORY & REPORTING

### SEC Filings

10-K: Annual report (audited)
- Complete financial statements
- Management discussion (MD&A)
- Risk factors
- Due within 60-90 days of fiscal year end

10-Q: Quarterly report (unaudited)
- Abbreviated financials
- Due within 40-45 days of quarter end

8-K: Current report (material events)
- M&A announcements
- CEO changes
- Bankruptcy
- Due within 4 days of event

Proxy Statement (DEF 14A):
- Executive compensation
- Board elections
- Shareholder proposals

### GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles)

US accounting standards set by FASB

Key Principles:
- Accrual basis (recognize when earned, not when cash received)
- Matching principle (match expenses to revenue period)
- Conservatism (recognize losses immediately, gains when realized)
- Materiality (only report significant items)

vs. IFRS (International):
More principles-based, used outside US

### Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)

Law passed 2002 after Enron/WorldCom

Key Requirements:
- CEO/CFO must certify financials (personal liability)
- Independent auditor oversight (PCAOB)
- Internal controls testing (Section 404)
- Whistleblower protections

Impact: Increased compliance costs, but improved financial reporting quality

---

## SECTION 10: COMMON PITFALLS & RED FLAGS

### Accounting Red Flags

1. Revenue growing faster than cash flow
   - Potential: Aggressive revenue recognition

2. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) increasing
   - Potential: Uncollectible receivables

3. Frequent "one-time" charges
   - Potential: Hiding recurring issues

4. Overly complex organizational structure
   - Potential: Obfuscation (Enron tactic)

5. Frequent auditor changes
   - Potential: Accounting disagreements

6. Executives selling large amounts of stock
   - Potential: Insiders know something market doesn't

7. Stock-based compensation excluded from "adjusted" earnings
   - Potential: Inflating profitability (real expense)

8. Capitalizing expenses
   - Potential: Boosting short-term earnings (WorldCom fraud)

9. Channel stuffing
   - Potential: Pulling future sales forward

10. Related party transactions
    - Potential: Siphoning money (Tyco, Adelphia)

### Valuation Pitfalls

1. Using wrong discount rate
   - Impact: 1% change in WACC can change valuation 15-20%

2. Overly optimistic terminal growth
   - Impact: Terminal value is 60-80% of DCF value
   - Reality check: Can't grow faster than GDP forever

3. Ignoring cyclicality
   - Impact: Valuing at peak earnings (looks cheap, actually expensive)

4. Not adjusting for one-time items
   - Impact: Overstating normalized earnings

5. Using reported earnings vs. cash flow
   - Impact: Earnings can be manipulated

6. Comparing companies with different capital structures
   - Impact: Use EV multiples, not equity multiples

7. Survivor bias in comps
   - Impact: Surviving companies trade at premium (failed peers delisted)

8. Not adjusting for dilution
   - Impact: Stock options, convertible debt increase share count

### Investment Mistakes

1. Anchoring on 52-week high
   - Mental trap: "It was $100, now $50, must be cheap"
   - Reality: Maybe it was overvalued at $100

2. Catching a falling knife
   - Buying declining stock because "it's down so much"
   - Reality: Can always go lower (ask Enron shareholders)

3. Ignoring liquidity
   - Small-cap with $50k daily volume
   - Reality: Can't exit without crashing price

4. Confusing revenue growth with value creation
   - Fast-growing but burning cash
   - Reality: Growth must be profitable (ROIC > WACC)

5. Extrapolating trends forever
   - "This company grows 50% YoY, will be $1 trillion in 5 years"
   - Reality: Competition, saturation, regression to mean

6. Confirmation bias
   - Only seeking info that confirms your view
   - Reality: Actively seek disconfirming evidence

7. Recency bias
   - "This strategy worked last 3 years, will work forever"
   - Reality: Markets cycle, strategies stop working
