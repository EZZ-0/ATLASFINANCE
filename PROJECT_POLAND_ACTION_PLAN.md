## Slide Deck Structure

### Slide 1: Title
```
SHOULD POLAND JOIN THE EUROZONE?

[Your Name]
[Course Name]
[Date]
```

---

### Slide 2: The Question
```
Poland's Situation:
• EU member since 2004
• Legally required to adopt Euro
• Has NOT joined - why?

This Presentation:
Poland SHOULD join... but NOT YET
```

---

### Slide 3: Background - Quick Facts
```
POLAND TODAY

Population: 38 million
GDP: $750 billion (6th largest EU)
Currency: Polish Zloty (PLN)
EU Member: 20 years

Key Fact: Fastest growing major EU economy
```

---

### Slide 4: What Are Maastricht Criteria?
```
ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR EURO

5 conditions a country must meet:

1. Inflation close to best performers
2. Interest rates close to best performers
3. Budget deficit under 3% of GDP
4. Government debt under 60% of GDP
5. Stable exchange rate for 2 years
```

---

### Slide 5: Poland's Scorecard
```
[INSERT VISUAL 1 - Maastricht Table]

Result: Poland FAILS 3 of 4 measurable criteria

Cannot join today even if wanted to
```

---

### Slide 6: The Inflation Problem
```
[INSERT VISUAL 2 - Inflation Chart]

• Poland: 5.3%
• Eurozone: 2.4%
• Gap: 2.9 percentage points

Poland was converging until 2021
COVID + Ukraine war reversed progress
```

---

### Slide 7: Trade with Eurozone
```
[INSERT VISUAL 3 - Pie Chart]

53% of Poland's exports go to Eurozone

Germany alone: 28% of all exports

Currency stability would help trade
```

---

### Slide 8: But Poland Grows Faster
```
[INSERT VISUAL 4 - GDP Bar Chart]

Poland GDP Growth: 3.5%
Eurozone GDP Growth: 0.9%

Different economies need different policies
One ECB rate may not fit Poland
```

---

### Slide 9: Arguments FOR Joining (Eventually)
```
WHY POLAND SHOULD JOIN

1. Eliminate currency exchange costs
   → 53% of trade with Eurozone

2. Lower interest rates
   → Cheaper borrowing for government & business

3. Attract more investment
   → No currency risk for investors

4. Deeper EU integration
   → More influence in ECB decisions
```

---

### Slide 10: Arguments for WAITING
```
WHY NOT YET

1. Inflation not under control
   → 5.3% vs ECB target of 2%

2. Budget deficit too high
   → 5.7% vs required 3%

3. Lose monetary flexibility
   → PLN depreciation helped in 2008-2009 crisis

4. Economy structure different
   → Poland grows faster, needs different rates
```

---

### Slide 11: Historical Example
```
LESSON FROM 2008 CRISIS

Poland was ONLY EU country to avoid recession

How? PLN depreciated 20%
→ Kept exports competitive
→ Cushioned the shock

With Euro: No depreciation possible
→ Would have needed internal devaluation (wage cuts)
```

---

### Slide 12: The Path Forward
```
WHEN SHOULD POLAND JOIN?

Conditions needed:
✓ Inflation below 3% for 2+ years
✓ Deficit below 3% for 2+ years
✓ Complete ERM II (2 years)
✓ Build public support

Realistic timeline: 2028-2030
```

---

### Slide 13: Conclusion
```
RECOMMENDATION

Poland SHOULD join the Eurozone
• Trade benefits are clear
• Integration benefits are real

But NOT YET
• Inflation must come down
• Deficit must be fixed
• Keep flexibility for now

Target: Late 2020s adoption
```

## Day 2: Polish + Practice (4-5 hours)

### Morning: Finish Slides (2 hours)

- Insert all 4 visuals
- Check formatting consistency

- Proofread all text

### Afternoon: Prepare to Present (2-3 hours)

**Speaker Notes (key points per slide):**

Slide 5 (Scorecard):
- "As you can see, Poland fails 3 of 4 criteria"
- "Only debt ratio passes"
- "This is why they cannot join today"

Slide 8 (GDP Growth):
- "This is the key argument for waiting"
- "Poland's economy behaves differently"
- "One-size-fits-all ECB policy may not work"

Slide 11 (2008 Crisis):
- "This is the strongest argument for keeping the zloty"
- "Flexibility saved Poland from recession"
- "No other EU country achieved this"

**Anticipate Questions:**

Q: "When exactly should Poland join?"
A: "When inflation stabilizes below 3% for 2+ years and deficit under 3%. Realistically 2028-2030."

Q: "What about political factors?"
A: "Public opinion is ~35% in favor. Government has no timeline. Economic conditions matter more for this analysis."

Q: "Didn't Slovakia join successfully?"
A: "Yes, in 2009. But Slovakia is smaller, more dependent on single industries, and joined before the 2010 debt crisis showed Euro's weaknesses."
