## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Which language version should I use?
**A:** Use the language the receiving party is most comfortable with. For KSA jurisdiction, if there's any conflict, the Arabic version prevails. For USA jurisdiction, the English version prevails.

### Q: Can I modify these templates?
**A:** Yes, but any modifications should be reviewed by an attorney. Any handwritten changes should be initialed by both parties.

### Q: What if the other party wants to use their NDA instead?
**A:** Review their NDA carefully with legal counsel. Ensure it covers all the key protections (confidentiality definition, duration, remedies, non-solicitation).

### Q: Do I need both Gregorian and Hijri dates for KSA?
**A:** Yes, Saudi legal documents typically include both calendar systems.

### Q: What's the difference between "Unilateral" and "Mutual"?
**A:** 
- **Unilateral**: Only you disclose confidential information; only they have obligations
- **Mutual**: Both parties disclose and both have obligations

### Q: How long does the NDA last?
**A:** The agreement term varies, but the confidentiality obligations continue for 5 years (or perpetually for trade secrets) after disclosure.
